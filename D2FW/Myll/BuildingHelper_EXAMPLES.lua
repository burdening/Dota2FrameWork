	Some tips:
	Put BuildingHelper:BlockGridNavSquares(nMapLength) in your InitGameMode function.
	Remember to call building:RemoveBuilding before the building dies (or in the entity_killed event) to re-open the closed squares.
	If units are getting stuck put "BoundsHullName"   "DOTA_HULL_SIZE_TOWER" for buildings in npc_units_custom.txt
